# JMO2 Stylus: CSS Styles for Public Pages
Some CSS styles to be applied to public websites, through a browser extension such as Stylus.

These are either my own custom CSS mods, or mods of existing CSS themes.

## Gmail, but more fun - [JMO2]
Last Updated: 2021.04.08

This style adds some more color to GMAIL by using Gmail's logo colors for different design elements.
Intended to work best with the default Gmail theme.

List of all Changes:
+ Top bar and search uses Red color.
+ Custom pixel-art GMAIL logo.
+ SVG Icons are white (to improve contrast).
+ Mail and Meet headers on left column use Blue color.
+ Scrollbars use green Color.
+ I added some slight contrast between the different columns, to help them be more distinguishable.
+ Added alternating line color for inboxes, to help see emails a bit better.

Due to the fast-moving nature of live websites, it's possible that changes made by Google will break these style rules in the future.

## WorkFlowy: Dark Theme, Terminal - [JMO2]
Last Updated: (2021-04-07)

This style is modified to be most compatible with Workflowy's own dark-theme.
This style basically makes it even darker (like an old computer terminal screen)
Also colorizes certain elements of WorkFlowy to make them more distinguishable.

I also added a "checkmark" to items that have been completed.
